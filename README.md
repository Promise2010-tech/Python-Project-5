Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! üèóÔ∏è
When I started designing my own class, I wanted to create something relatable and fun. I decided to represent Animals as a class. I gave it methods to define actions for different animals, like barking for a dog and hissing for a snake. It was fascinating to see how I could bring these animals to life with just a few lines of code.

To make it more dynamic, I added a constructor to initialize each animal with unique attributes, like its name or type. Then, I explored inheritance by creating subclasses for specific animals, allowing me to add unique behaviors for each one. This helped me understand how to reuse code effectively while keeping it organized.

Polymorphism Challenge! üé≠
For the polymorphism challenge, I wanted to see how different animals could perform the same action in their own unique way. For example, a dog might "move" by running, while a snake might "move" by slithering. I created a base class and then defined the move() method differently for each animal.

When I ran the program, it was amazing to see how each animal's behavior was distinct, even though they all shared the same method name. This exercise really helped me grasp the concept of polymorphism and how it allows for flexibility and creativity in programming.
